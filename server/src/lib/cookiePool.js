/**
 * Rotation over a pool of yt-dlp cookies.txt files.
 *
 * YouTube revokes a cookie session's validity on its own schedule — driven by
 * how automated the traffic looks to its abuse detection, not by the expiry
 * timestamps written in the file. A datacenter host can burn through a
 * session in days regardless of what the file claims. Rather than requiring
 * a human to notice and swap the file by hand, a directory of cookie files
 * (one per throwaway account) is tried in rotation: a file that gets
 * bot-checked is marked dead for a cooldown and skipped, and the next file in
 * the pool is used automatically on the very next call.
 *
 * This does not remove the need to occasionally add a fresh cookie file to
 * the pool — Google can eventually flag all of them — but it removes the
 * manual "notice it broke, SSH in, swap the path" step for every account
 * except the last one standing.
